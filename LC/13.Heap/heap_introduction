1. What is heap 

Heap is a complete binary tree and root will be greater than decentant if max heap:
There are two type of heap 
    1. Max heap  
    2. Min Heap 
Duplicats are also allowed . It is heap not the binary search tree 

  Heap property - 
    arr[k]
    parent node = arr[(k-1)/2]
    Left child = arr[(2*k)+1]
    Right chhild = arr[(2*k)+2]

What is the benefit 

Data structre - Mostly representaion by array but linked list also  
Time complexity :
Space complexity :

Condition applicable for complete binary tree:
How to calculate height of tree if nodes are given ?

How to calculate total nodes if height is given of a tree?
Max number of nodes = 2^(h+1) -1
Height of a tree = [log n] - floor function
